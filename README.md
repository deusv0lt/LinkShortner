# Link Shortener

A simple URL shortener made as a small project to learn React and interacting with APIs using Axios. This uses bit.ly's API to shorten links.
If you really want to use this for some unfathomable reason, just generate an API key [here](https://dev.bitly.com/) and you're good to go.
